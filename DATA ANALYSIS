ABSTRACT
A new methodology for cross-selling in insurance is presented in this paper. 
The optimal cross-sales selection of prospects is such that the expected profit is maximized, 
while at the same time the risk of suffering future losses is minimized.
In order to solve these optimality problems a stochastic model of the profit, 
expected to emerge from a single cross-sales prospect and from a selection of prospects, is developed.  
This is shown to achieve considerable profit gains, compared to traditional cross-selling methods.
Cross selling the right policies to the customer hepls the insurance industry to attain maximum profit.
